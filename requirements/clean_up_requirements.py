"""
Utility to uninstall any installed packages listed in uninstall.txt.  Can't use
``pip uninstall -r`` because it aborts after the first package in the list
which isn't currently installed.  Also installs the currently-recommended
versions of setuptools and pip from requirements/nest.txt (to avoid needing
to replicate this logic in git-hooks/post-merge, tox.ini, quilter, etc.)
